# Year 1 - Course Materials and Labs

## Overview
This folder contains all the laboratory work, projects, and materials for the first year of my university program. It covers foundational courses in mathematics, probability, physics, and numerical analysis.

## Course Structure

### MD - Discrete Mathematics
This folder contains materials related to the Discrete Mathematics course. 

**Topics covered:**
- Set theory
- Logic
- Graph theory
- Combinatorics
- Number theory

### PSA - Probability and Statistical Analysis
This folder includes labs and projects from the Probability course.

**Topics covered:**
- Basic probability concepts
- Random variables
- Probability distributions
- Statistical inference
- Hypothesis testing

### Octave - Physics
This folder contains Octave scripts and projects primarily focused on physics applications.

**Topics covered:**
- Mechanics
- Thermodynamics
- Electromagnetism
- Optics
- Introduction to Octave programming

### NA - Numerical Analysis
This folder includes materials from the Numerical Analysis course.

**Topics covered:**
- Numerical solutions to equations
- Interpolation and approximation
- Numerical integration and differentiation
- Numerical linear algebra
- Ordinary differential equations

## Usage
Each course folder may contain the following:
- Lab reports
- Source code (particularly for Octave and Numerical Analysis)
- Data sets
- Project documentation

To explore the contents:
1. Navigate to the desired course folder (MD, PSA, Octave, or NA)
2. Browse through the individual lab or project folders
3. Refer to any specific README files within each folder for more detailed information

## Tools and Software
- Octave: Used primarily in the Physics and potentially in the Numerical Analysis course
- Other software or programming languages specific to each course will be detailed in the respective folders

## Note on Academic Integrity
