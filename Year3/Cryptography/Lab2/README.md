# Cryptography Text Analysis Laboratory

## Overview
This laboratory project focuses on analyzing and decrypting text using frequency analysis and letter substitution techniques. It provides tools for reading encrypted text, performing letter substitutions, analyzing letter frequencies, and visualizing the results.

## Features
- Read encrypted text from a file
- Perform letter substitutions to decrypt the text
- Analyze letter frequencies in the text
- Compare frequency distribution with standard English language letter frequencies
- Visualize letter frequency distributions
- Write decrypted text to a file

## Files
- `main.py`: The main script that orchestrates the decryption process
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for text analysis, file operations, and visualization

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (matplotlib).
2. Place your encrypted text in a file named `encrypted.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` script:

##  Example of a Frequency Analysis Attack
We intercepted a ciphertext c, which we know was obtained using a monoalphabetic cipher on a message written in English:

The first step was to find the frequencies of all letters appearing in the ciphertext. We used the `find_frequency` function to calculate these frequencies and `plot_frequency`
to get a better understanding of them:

```python
frequency = find_frequency(str)
plot_frequency(frequency, label="Frequency of encrypted text")
plot_frequency(english_language_letters_frequency, label="Frequency of English language")
```
<p float="left">

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9262f13-a025-419f-a6d2-2c3cd0fc69db" width="47%" /> 
</p>

After calculating the frequencies, we started making substitutions based on the most common letters in English. We used the `substitute_letters` function for each substitution:

```python
str = substitute_letters(str, 'V', 'e')
str = substitute_letters(str, 'W', 't')
```

We started with the most frequent letters. In our ciphertext, 'V' was very common, so we substituted it with 'e', the most common letter in English. Similarly, 'W' was substituted with 't', the second most common letter in English.
As we made these substitutions, patterns began to emerge. For example, after substituting 'V' with 'e' and 'W' with 't', we might have seen words like "the" starting to form, confirming our guesses.
We continued this process, using our knowledge of English letter frequencies and common words to guide our substitutions. For instance:
- 'Q' was substituted with 'h', as we might have seen "tQe" and guessed it was "the".
- 'T' became 'a', possibly from seeing common words like "Tnd" (and) or "ThTt" (that).
- 'G' was changed to 'n', perhaps from seeing "iG" at the end of words, a common English ending.

```python
str = substitute_letters(str, 'Q', 'h')
str = substitute_letters(str, 'T', 'a')
str = substitute_letters(str, 'G', 'n')
```

After this substitutions our text had started to show more guessable letters, which started obvious substitutions.

We proceeded through all 26 letters, making educated guesses based on the emerging patterns in the text and our knowledge of English language structures.
After completing all substitutions, we wrote the decrypted text to a file:

```python
write_to_file(str, "decrypted.txt")
```

This process of frequency analysis and educated guessing allowed us to break the monoalphabetic cipher without knowing the key, demonstrating the vulnerability of this encryption method to statistical analysis.
In the end we got our decrypted text:
- realmont was under siege. the royal army, under henry ii of bourbon,prince of conde, had invested it at dawn wednesday, april 19, 1628. butthe huguenots, inside the battlements of the little town in southernfrance, were putting up a stiff defense. they cannonaded conde from atower and contemptuously rejected his demands that they surrender,saying that they would die instead. conde brought up five big cannonfrom albi, a dozen miles away, and on sunday ranged them in anominous line facing realmont.that same day his soldiers captured an inhabitant of the town whowas trying to carry an enciphered message to huguenot forces outside.none of conde's men could unriddle it, but during the week the princelearned that it might be solved by the scion of a leading family of albiwho was known to have an interest in ciphers.conde sent him the cryptogram. the young man solved it on the spot.it revealed that the huguenots desperately needed munitions and that, ifthey were not supplied, they would have to yield. this was news indeed,for despite the destruction of a number of houses by the catholicbatteries, the town was continuing to resist stoutly with no sign ofsurrender. conde returned the cryptogram to the inhabitants, and onsunday, april 30, 1628, though its fortifications were still unbreachedand its defenses still apparently adequate for a long siege, realmontsuddenly and unexpectedly capitulated. with this dramatic successbegan the career of the man who was to become france's first full-timecryptologist: the great antoine rossignol.when word of the incident reached cardinal richelieu, the astute andable gray eminence of france, he at once attached this useful talent tohis suite. rossignol proved his worth almost immediately. the catholicarmies under richelieu surrounding the chief huguenot bastion of larochelle intercepted some letters in cipher, which the young codebreakerof albi read with ease. he told his eminence that the starving citizenswere eagerly awaiting help that the english had promised to send by sea. when the fleetarrived, the primed guardships and forts so intimidated it that it stoodoff the port's entrance and made no serious attempt to force a passage. amonth later, the city capitulated in full sight of the english vessels�andthe great french tradition of expertise in cryptology had been founded.rossignol very quickly established himself in the royal service. by1630, his solutions had made him rich enough to build a small butelegant chateau at juvisy, 12 miles south of paris, later surrounding itwith a charming informal garden designed by le notre, the gardener ofversailles. here louis xiii stopped to visit the young crypt-analyst in1634, 1635 and 1636 on his returns to paris from fontainebleau.in the swashbuckling court of that monarch, and then in theresplendent one of louis xiv, rossignol served with an extraordinaryfacility. the stronghold of hesdin surrendered a week sooner than itotherwise would have because he solved an enciphered plea for help, andthen composed a reply in the same cipher telling the townspeople howfutile their hopes were. how many other towns he compelled tosurrender, how many diplomatic coups he made possible, how manybetrayals he uncovered among the great nobles in those days of shiftingallegiances, he never discussed. this reticence caused some at the courtto charge that he never actually solved a single cipher, and that thecardinal spread inflated rumors about his abilities to discourage would-be conspirators. but in fact richelieu was frequently telling hissubordinates such things as,it is necessary to make use, in my opinion,of the letters of the man who has been arrested by the civil authorities atmezieres, that is to say, have them put into rossignol's hands to see ifthere is something important in them. or, eight years later, in 1642,writing to messieurs de noyers and de chavigny:i saw, in someextracts, that rossignol sent me, a truce negotiation of the king ofengland with the prince of orange; i do not think that it can have anyeffect, but ... it is up to you, gentlemen, to keep your eyes peeled
